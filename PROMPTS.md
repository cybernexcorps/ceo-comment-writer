## CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

Follow these requirements in order of priority:

### 1. УЧЁТ СПЕЦИФИКИ СМИ (Media Outlet Adaptation)
**Target Outlet:** ${media}

Adapt your comment to match this outlet's style:
- **Sostav.ru**: Industry insider tone, professional terminology, 1,500-2,000 chars
- **Cossa.ru**: Digital marketing focus, practical applications, 1,200-1,800 chars
- **Forbes Russia**: CEO business perspective, strategic vision, 1,800-2,200 chars
- **RBC**: Authoritative journalism, data-driven, 1,500-2,000 chars
- **VC.ru**: Startup-friendly, accessible, practical advice, 1,200-1,800 chars
- **Секрет фирмы**: Management systems focus, operational perspective, 1,500-2,200 chars
- **Adindex.ru**: Advertising insider, industry-specific, 1,200-1,800 chars

### 2. ПРЯМОЙ ОТВЕТ (Direct Answer Requirement)
**Journalist's Question:** ${question}

**CRITICAL:** Your comment MUST directly answer this specific question. Do not:
- Drift to related but different topics
- Provide generic commentary that doesn't address the question
- Answer a different question than what was asked

**Verification Step:** Before finalizing, confirm: "Does my comment directly answer: '${question}'?"

### 3. ОРИГИНАЛЬНОЕ МНЕНИЕ (Original Insights)
Provide unique insights based on ${profile.name}'s expertise, not:
- Общеизвестные истины (common knowledge everyone knows)
- Generic statements without substance
- Rehashed industry platitudes

**Required:** Include at least one specific insight, fact, or perspective unique to ${profile.name}'s experience.

### 4. ОБЪЁМ (Target Length)
**Target:** ${profile.default_target_length || targetLength} characters (approximately ${targetParagraphs} paragraphs)

**Length Guidelines:**
- Too short (< 1,200 chars): Lacks depth, appears rushed
- Too long (> 2,200 chars): Loses reader attention, may be edited down
- Optimal: ${targetLength} characters provides sufficient depth without overwhelming

### 5. CONTINUITY & CONSISTENCY
${currentIteration > 1 ? `**This is revision #${currentIteration}** - Apply feedback while maintaining:\n- Original question alignment\n- ${profile.name}'s authentic voice\n- Media outlet style (${media})\n- Target length (${targetLength} characters)` : '**First iteration** - Establish baseline quality and voice consistency'}

2. You MUST visit/browse this URL to understand the topic.
3. Do not just rely on the URL text, access the content.
```

## How to Modify Prompts

### Option 1: Edit in n8n Workflow (Recommended for Quick Changes)

1. Open the workflow in n8n
2. Find the **"Build AI Agent Prompt with Memory"** node (or **"Build Humanize Prompt"** node)
3. Click to edit the Code node
4. Locate the template string (the text between backticks after `const systemMessage = ` or `const userMessage = `)
5. Make your changes
6. Save and test

### Option 2: Edit JSON File Directly

1. Open `ceo-comment-writer-workflow-multi.json`
2. Find the node with `"id": "build-ai-prompt"` (line ~177) or `"id": "build-humanize-prompt"` (line ~230)
3. Locate the `jsCode` parameter
4. Find the template strings within the JavaScript code
5. Make your changes (be careful with escaping - backticks, newlines, etc.)
6. Import the updated workflow into n8n

### Option 3: Use This Document as Reference

1. Modify the templates in this markdown file
2. Copy the modified template
3. Paste into the n8n Code node, replacing the existing template
4. Ensure all `${variable}` placeholders are preserved

### Important Notes

- **Variable Syntax**: All variables use `${variableName}` syntax
- **Escaping**: In JavaScript template literals, you may need to escape:
  - Backticks: Use `` `${variable}` `` or `` \`${variable}\` ``
  - Dollar signs: Use `\${` if you want a literal `${`
  - Newlines: Use `\n` for line breaks
- **Conditional Logic**: The prompts use JavaScript template literals, so you can use ternary operators: `${condition ? 'value1' : 'value2'}`
- **Arrays**: Use `.map()` and `.join()` to convert arrays to formatted lists

### Testing Changes

After modifying prompts:

1. Test with a simple request first
2. Check that all variables are properly injected
3. Verify the output format matches expectations
4. Test revision flow (feedback loop) if you modified the revision context
5. Test with different profiles if you modified profile-dependent sections
